# ZynloMedia Website

This repository contains a simple static website for **ZynloMedia**, a Brisbane-based social media marketing agency.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview the site.
2. Optionally serve the files with a static server for local development.

### Example using Python
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Build & Deploy
No build step is required. Deploy the repository as a static site (e.g., via Netlify or Vercel). The `index.html`, `styles.css`, `scripts.js`, and `assets` folder should be uploaded.

## Style Guide
